<summary>Install OpenJDK 11</summary>

The minimum JDK version is 8 or higher for REST ASSURED, but we'll use version 11.&#x20;

OpenJDK 11 brings several important changes and improvements over older versions of the JDK, particularly when compared to Java 8, which was a widely used LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Here are some of the key aspects that make OpenJDK 11 special and differentiate it from older JDK versions:

1. **Modularity (JPMS):** Simplifies dependency management with the Java Platform Module System.
2. **Local Variable Type Inference:** Enhances code readability using the `var` keyword.
3. **New Features:** Introduces useful APIs like enhanced String methods and TLS 1.3 support.
4. **Garbage Collection:** Improved algorithms for better performance and reduced pauses.
5. **Performance:** Faster startup, enhanced garbage collection, and AOT compilation with GraalVM.
6. **LTS Support:** Java 11 is an LTS release, offering long-term support.
7. **Security:** Contains essential security updates for safer applications.
8. **Stability:** Rigorous testing ensures reliability for production use.
