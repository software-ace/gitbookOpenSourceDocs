3. **New Features:** Introduces useful APIs like enhanced String methods and TLS 1.3 support.
4. **Garbage Collection:** Improved algorithms for better performance and reduced pauses.
5. **Performance:** Faster startup, enhanced garbage collection, and AOT compilation with GraalVM.
6. **LTS Support:** Java 11 is an LTS release, offering long-term support.
7. **Security:** Contains essential security updates for safer applications.
8. **Stability:** Rigorous testing ensures reliability for production use.
9. **Compatibility:** Maintains strong backward compatibility.
